# Abstraction

# What is Abstraction
# abstraction is used to hide the internal implementation (functionality) of the func from user
# user is familiar with that what function does , but they dont know how it does 


# Python does not support abstraction directly


# 1 - abstract class ?

# abstract class which have abstract method and concrete method called abstract class
# abstract class is like a blueprint for all classes
# we cant create instance of the abstract class


# 2 - abstract method ?

# abstract methods are those methods whith only declear but not implement 

# 3 - concrete method ?

# general methods called as concrete methods ,declearation as well as implementation 


# 4 - interface ?

# those classess which have only abstract method called as interface


# Why use Abstract Base Class.

# When we want to provide a common interface for different implementation of a component
#  we use abstract class

# By defining an abstract base class you can define a common Application program Interface (API)
# this capability is especially useful in situationswhere 3rd party is going to provide implementation
# eg such as with plugings

# when we working in a large team or with a lager-code-base where keeping all class in your mind is
# difficult or not possible
